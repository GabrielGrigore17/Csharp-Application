# Csharp-Application
This is a project where I test my skills regarding C# and related Microsoft frameworks. Currently it doesn't have a defined course but I will start to add different features with the aid of open source code and personal designs. It's just a learning experience.
Currently I plan on developing within the .NET framework. The app will also make use of a SQL database integration (I have no idea how I'm going to do that yet :) )
